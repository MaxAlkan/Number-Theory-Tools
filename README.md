Some basic tools for number theory related problems
-Euler Totient: Computes the number of relatively prime positive integers less than n.

Future project: Zeckendorf Representation Calculator.
  Zeckendorf's theorem states that any positive integer can be represented by a sum of unique, non consecutive fibbonacci
  numbers.This program will take a given input n and output its corresponding Zeckendorf Representation.
